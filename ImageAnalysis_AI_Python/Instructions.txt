You upload a food image.

Gemini analyzes the image and clearly identifies the food item, if possible.

It estimates the calorie content and includes a confidence level (High, Medium, or Low).

It lists three key nutritional facts, such as fat content, fiber, or sugar levels.

It gives a short summary in under 20 words.

If the food can't be confidently identified, it clearly says so without guessing.
